            <h2>Meet Siya</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Siya Sonpatki, a third-year undergraduate. As a student pursuing an Honors Bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in A.I, I am looking for opportunities to build on my academic knowledge and gain industry experience while making impactful contributions through software development and collaboration with a team and clientele.
            </p>

            <p>
              Given my proactive and curious nature, I am constantly searching for means to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills, both technically and interpersonally. In a recent collaborative project, I designed and implemented a software application using a microservices architecture, focusing on Python and ZeroMQ. Within our team, each member developed their own application and integrated a functionality created by a teammate into our individual projects. Additionally, I have begun designing and implementing a portfolio website to develop my proficiencies in coding languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my knowledge of software concepts, such as communication pipelines, hosting platforms, and deployment.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am excited for future opportunities to support and contribute to software engineering projects, and bridge my academic knowledge and professional capacities to deliver impactful Frontend solutions while growing as a software developer.
